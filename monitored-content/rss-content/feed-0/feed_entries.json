Demo of Copilot code review highlighting an issue and providing a suggestion to apply in Xcode editor New enterprise and organization control We\u2019ve introduced a new setting that gives enterprises and organizations dedicated control over Copilot code review (CCR). You now have clearer, more predictable controls for managing Copilot code review across your enterprise, whether you use it on GitHub, in VS Code, or as part of a standalone Copilot setup. What\u2019s new Independent control: Turn Copilot code review on or off separately from other Copilot features like Copilot chat. Seamless transition: By default, CCR follows your existing Copilot setup, so there\u2019s no disruption. Public preview option: Users can opt in to try new CCR features early. VS Code included: This setting also applies to Copilot code review in Visual Studio Code. Available everywhere: The new control is available for both organizations and standalone enterprises (including Copilot-only enterprises without organizations or repositories). New block policy: Enterprises can now enforce \u201cBlock Copilot code review in all enterprise repositories\u201d to fully disable CCR for all users, including individually licensed Copilot users. If your enterprise has enabled the Copilot on GitHub.com policy (or sub-policies for preview features), CCR remains on by default. Going forward, it must be managed separately from those policies. For questions about these changes, join the conversation in our GitHub Community discussion.
