After the repository is created, Copilot will open a draft pull request, write the requested code, and then request a review from you. This makes it easier than ever to get started on new projects. Copilot coding agent is available to Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise subscribers. If you\u2019re a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscriber, an administrator will have to enable Copilot coding agent from the \u201cPolicies\u201d page before you can use it.

This new dashboard aims to help enterprise customers, organizations, and individual developers easily understand how their usage translates to their final bill and provide answers to common premium request usage questions. The analytics page will be available as a subpage within the \u201cBilling\u201d platform pages. For more information, reference our billing documentation. Access to the analytics page follows the same pattern as the rest of the billing platform experience. It will be available to enterprise owners, organization owners, billing managers, and personal account users with Copilot subscriptions. We\u2019re also shipping a dedicated API endpoint for premium request analytics data that allows users to build internal dashboards, create custom usage reports, and easily track expenses across teams. For more information reference our API documentation. Key features With the new analytics dashboard, you can: View total usage for premium requests across all products that consume premium requests. Track the count of premium requests consumed beyond your monthly quota. Monitor the total number of included premium requests consumed (i.e., requests used within your monthly quota). Filter usage by user, model, organization, and cost center. View detailed breakdowns by the number of included and billed premium requests.

      "content": "Organizations often struggle to turn ideas into working software. Weeks go into specs or mocks that rarely make it to production, and even when they do, they often miss the mark. GitHub Spark changes that by enabling teams to focus on the what, not the how: validate ideas early with rapid prototypes, get concepts into production that might otherwise stall in the backlog, and collaborate around live applications instead of fragmented docs or mockups. Built directly into the GitHub platform that millions of developers already rely on, Spark offers a streamlined path from prototype to production. Repositories, Dependabot, Codespaces, and Copilot all work together out of the box, so teams can move faster without leaving the tools they trust. Developers, product managers, designers, and other team members can centralize collaboration around interactive prototypes, break down silos, and create internal tools that make everyday work more efficient. Key features Natural language to app: Describe your idea and watch Spark build it, with frontend and backend capabilities included. No setup required: Data, LLM inference, hosting, deployments, and GitHub auth all included out of the box. Add AI to your apps: Add intelligent features powered by LLMs from OpenAI, Meta, DeepSeek, xAI, and more\u2014no API key management needed. One-click deployments: Publish your app with a single click, with various controls to make sharing secure for you and your team. Build your way: Use natural language, visual editing controls, or code with GitHub Copilot code completions at your fingertips to iterate on your ideas. Create a repository: Get a repository with your favorite functionality included in just a click. Everything stays synchronized so you aren\u2019t trapped in a sandbox. Expand with Copilot agents: Open a codespace directly from Spark to iterate with Copilot agent mode or assign an issue to Copilot coding agent. Now available for Copilot Enterprise customers Spark is available today in public preview for all Copilot Enterprise customers. Spark messages use premium requests included in GitHub Copilot plans. How to enable Spark for your organization By default, Spark is disabled. Enterprise admins can enable Spark as follows: Navigate to your Enterprise Policies tab on github.com. Select Copilot in the left sidebar. Scroll down to the \u201cFeatures\u201d section where you will see \u201cSpark\u201d. Change the Spark policy setting to Enabled, which will enable Spark for all Copilot Enterprise users associated with your enterprise. Optionally, you can change the Spark policy setting at the enterprise level to No Policy and enable it at the organization level, which will enable Spark for only certain organizations within your enterprise. Once enabled, all Copilot subscribers associated with your enterprise or organization can access Spark at github.com/spark. Learn more View more details on the Spark product page. Read the Spark documentation. Join the discussion to share your feedback and ask questions. Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.

      "content": "We\u2019re announcing the scheduled deprecation of the GitHub Copilot in the CLI extension for GitHub CLI (i.e., gh-copilot) which will stop working on October 25, 2025. This extension\u2019s capabilities are being replaced by the new GitHub Copilot CLI, a fully agentic AI assistant that provides the full power of Copilot\u2019s coding agent locally in your terminal. What\u2019s changing The gh-copilot extension will be deprecated and stop functioning on October 25, 2025. Enterprise customers with the \u201cCopilot in the CLI\u201d policy currently enabled will notice we\u2019re automatically disabling this policy. We\u2019re doing this so administrators can review whether to allow access to the new Copilot CLI, which is now in public preview. The new Copilot CLI provides a much more powerful, agentic experience compared to the limited suggestion capabilities of gh-copilot. Migration and alternatives Copilot Pro and Enterprise users: We recommend migrating to the new GitHub Copilot CLI, which offers enhanced agentic capabilities. Free plan users: Since the new Copilot CLI isn\u2019t available on the free plan, we recommend using Ask mode in Visual Studio Code to get explanations and command suggestions. Alternatively, you could explore the gh-models extension to interact with AI models via the GitHub CLI. For more information about the new GitHub Copilot CLI, visit the GitHub Copilot CLI repository.
