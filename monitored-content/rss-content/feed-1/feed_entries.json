    "content": "We're bringing you a range of additional options for assigning Copilot to issues as part of this public preview. When assigning an issue to Copilot coding agent, you can now choose which repository Copilot should work in, pick a starting branch, and provide additional instructions to give it more context. CCA.issue.assign.mp4 Here\u2019s what\u2019s new: Start Copilot assignment in one click: Assign tasks directly to Copilot with the new Assign to Copilot button. This feature makes it easier and faster to start a Copilot assignment with a single click. Pick the target repository: Choose any repository you have access to, even if your issues and code don't live in the same place. Now you can work with Copilot across repositories, so it's easy to start assignments from issues no matter where your code is stored. Pick a starting branch: Choose which branch Copilot should start from. Whether you want Copilot to work off a feature branch, a bug fix branch, or any other starting point, you now have the flexibility to direct Copilot\u2019s work to exactly where you want it. Add additional instructions: Give Copilot more context with optional instructions. You can provide specific guidance, requirements, or extra details to help Copilot understand exactly what you want to accomplish. This makes assignments more precise and helps Copilot deliver results that match your needs.

    "published": "2025-09-18T10:12:44+00:00",
    "content": "Starting November 18, 2025, GitHub will begin removing all $0 Copilot premium request budgets for enterprise and team accounts created before August 22, 2025. As a result, premium request paid usage will be governed by your account\u2019s premium request paid usage policy, not a static $0 budget. Who is affected? All enterprise and org accounts with an account-level $0 Copilot premium request budget created before August 22, 2025 are affected. Pro and Pro+ Copilot users are not affected and will continue to have $0 budgets by default. Why are we making this change? Enables granular controls without complexity: Starting in October, each AI tool will have their own dedicated SKUs for tracking and managing premium request usage, beginning with coding agent and Spark. Keeping the $0 budget model would require you to manually create and manage separate $0 budgets for each new AI tool, creating unnecessary administrative burden as we expand our AI capabilities. Simplifies billing: Removing this budget option eliminates friction and manual intervention for admins, letting you scale AI usage with confidence. What do you need to do? To control premium request paid usage, review and update your premium request paid usage policy. You can disable paid usage at any time in your Copilot policy settings. Learn more in our documentation on premium requests. Questions For questions, feedback, and any thoughts, please comment in the discussion below!",

Enterprise owners can now: Add users directly to the enterprise without requiring organization access. These unaffiliated users do not consume a license by default. Create and manage groups of users in the enterprise account through Enterprise Teams. Enterprise accounts with Enterprise Managed Users can synchronize groups of users from their identity provider to Enterprise Teams via SCIM. Manage Copilot Business licenses for individuals or entire enterprise teams through the enterprise-level Copilot licensing page. What Enterprise Teams enable \u2753 In the coming months, enterprise owners will also be able to use enterprise teams to: Assign an enterprise role. Assign it to a number of organizations within that enterprise, granting organization membership. Empower organization and repository owners to assign roles to teams within their scope. Unaffiliated users (non-EMU enterprises) \ud83d\udc40 For enterprises that do not use enterprise-managed users (EMU), enterprise owners can now invite unaffiliated users to their enterprise. These users will not have access to organizations or licenses by default, but can later be assigned to an enterprise team, an organization, or Copilot Business license. If a user is removed from all organizations, they will remain in the enterprise as an unaffiliated user unless the remove from enterprise action is taken. Since users may not be automatically removed from your enterprise, we recommend reviewing your offboarding process to ensure it accounts for this change. Copilot Business licensing updates \ud83d\udcbc Along with enterprise teams and unaffiliated users now being available to all enterprises, updates have been made to Copilot Business licensing. Enterprise owners can use a dedicated Copilot Business licensing page to assign users and enterprise teams. These updates provide more flexible and scalable license management for enterprises, including the ability to assign Copilot Business to users without also requiring a GitHub Enterprise Cloud license.

Join the preview This feature is available in private preview. \u27a1\ufe0f Sign up for the preview here Key Features \u2728 Integrate External Tools: Add MCP servers to connect Copilot with external sources for code, docs, design files, issue trackers, monitoring, and more. Flexible & Open: Supported integrations include both official and open-source servers. Servers must be remotely hosted, support SSE/Streamable HTTP, and comply with OAuth 2.1. Contextual Intelligence: Copilot intelligently invokes tools provided by your MCP servers based on your chat requests and each tool\u2019s description. Security First: Only install servers you trust. Info shared with external servers may include proprietary data\u2014review access and permissions before connecting. Favorite Use Cases \u2b50 Project Management Integration: Bring in issues and tasks from Jira so Copilot can answer project-related questions and automate workflows. Documentation & Knowledge Base: Integrate Notion or Confluence so Copilot can reference up-to-date docs, onboarding guides, and FAQs. Monitoring & Alerts: Use Sentry integration to discuss error reports, incidents, and troubleshooting steps in context. Custom Workflows: Leverage open-source MCP servers for niche tools, internal systems, or personalized automation.

This will provide you with simplified control over how your enterprise or organization handles premium request usage beyond your account's included usage. What's changing Instead of an automatically-created $0 budget that blocks usage when your premium requests are exhausted, you can now manage overages through a dedicated policy in your Copilot settings. The policy offers you two options: Enabled (default) - Allow charges for usage beyond your account's included premium requests Disabled - Block usage when your included premium requests are exhausted If you have an existing $0 premium request budget in your account, it will not be removed. You can remove or modify this budget at any time. What's not changing Copilot for individuals (Pro/Pro+) plans are not affected at this time. If you have a premium request budget in your account, it remains unchanged. Your included premium requests and seat pricing remain the same. Your current budgets continue to work as before.
