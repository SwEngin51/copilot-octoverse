    "content": "\ud83c\udd95 GitHub Enterprise Cloud now offers Enterprise Teams in public preview, streamlining enterprise user and Copilot license management experiences for businesses. Enterprise owners can now: Add users directly to the enterprise without requiring organization access. These unaffiliated users do not consume a license by default. Create and manage groups of users in the enterprise account through Enterprise Teams. Enterprise accounts with Enterprise Managed Users can synchronize groups of users from their identity provider to Enterprise Teams via SCIM. Manage Copilot Business licenses for individuals or entire enterprise teams through the enterprise-level Copilot licensing page. What Enterprise Teams enable \u2753 In the coming months, enterprise owners will also be able to use enterprise teams to: Assign an enterprise role. Assign it to a number of organizations within that enterprise, granting organization membership. Empower organization and repository owners to assign roles to teams within their scope. Unaffiliated users (non-EMU enterprises) \ud83d\udc40 For enterprises that do not use enterprise-managed users (EMU), enterprise owners can now invite unaffiliated users to their enterprise. These users will not have access to organizations or licenses by default, but can later be assigned to an enterprise team, an organization, or Copilot Business license. If a user is removed from all organizations, they will remain in the enterprise as an unaffiliated user unless the remove from enterprise action is taken. Since users may not be automatically removed from your enterprise, we recommend reviewing your offboarding process to ensure it accounts for this change. Copilot Business licensing updates \ud83d\udcbc Along with enterprise teams and unaffiliated users now being available to all enterprises, updates have been made to Copilot Business licensing. Enterprise owners can use a dedicated Copilot Business licensing page to assign users and enterprise teams. These updates provide more flexible and scalable license management for enterprises, including the ability to assign Copilot Business to users without also requiring a GitHub Enterprise Cloud license. Join us in the comments below to share your feedback and ask questions. \ud83d\udc47 Learn more To learn more, check out our documentation on Enterprise Teams, unaffiliated users, and Copilot Business licensing.

With MCP servers, Copilot can leverage external information sources (like Atlassian, Notion, Sentry, Linear, and more) to provide richer, more contextual responses in GitHub. Join the preview This feature is available in private preview. \u27a1\ufe0f Sign up for the preview here Key Features \u2728 Integrate External Tools: Add MCP servers to connect Copilot with external sources for code, docs, design files, issue trackers, monitoring, and more. Flexible & Open: Supported integrations include both official and open-source servers. Servers must be remotely hosted, support SSE/Streamable HTTP, and comply with OAuth 2.1. Contextual Intelligence: Copilot intelligently invokes tools provided by your MCP servers based on your chat requests and each tool\u2019s description. Security First: Only install servers you trust. Info shared with external servers may include proprietary data\u2014review access and permissions before connecting. Favorite Use Cases \u2b50 Project Management Integration: Bring in issues and tasks from Jira so Copilot can answer project-related questions and automate workflows. Documentation & Knowledge Base: Integrate Notion or Confluence so Copilot can reference up-to-date docs, onboarding guides, and FAQs. Monitoring & Alerts: Use Sentry integration to discuss error reports, incidents, and troubleshooting steps in context. Custom Workflows: Leverage open-source MCP servers for niche tools, internal systems, or personalized automation. Getting Started Go to github.com/copilot Select Tools > New Tool Enter your server URL and complete authentication, if required Start chatting with Copilot\u2014now powered by your external sources! To remove a server, visit github.com/settings/mcp. Important Security Notice \u26a0\ufe0f Only install MCP servers you trust. Do not install servers on accounts with sensitive/confidential info unless sharing is explicitly permitted. GitHub assumes no responsibility for data sent to external servers. Please Share Feedback \ud83e\udd1d This is an early preview, and your feedback is vital! Try adding a MCP Server and let us know what you think\u2014comment below or use the inline feedback button.

Key Features \u2728 Create a space Organize code, docs, files, and other project context into a space. Add custom instructions to help guide responses. We\u2019ve made some adjustments to how Copilot works with context in Spaces, so context groundedness should be very high. Context is always based on the latest state of your main branch. Chat with a space Ask Copilot questions grounded in the context of your Space for more accurate and relevant answers. Share it with teammates You can share spaces with other members of your organization. Some of our favorite use cases \u2b50 Answering questions about code: Chris Westra is an engineer on the Spaces team. He grouped all of the code associated with Spaces and added video transcripts from a recorded Spaces session. We use this Space to answer questions about how Spaces works under-the-hood (very meta). \ud83d\ude42 Standardizing coding standards and best practices: Rahul Zhade works on a team that advises engineers on secure coding practices. He often answers the same questions over-and-over again in Slack, so he set up a Space. It contains the documentation for our standard auth model, how to do cryptography as well as instructions on how to go through the security review process. Writing SQL/KQL queries: Kelly Henckel is a product manager who is very good at writing SQL and KQL queries. She\u2019s created spaces designed to help people self-service writing data queries and creating dashboards. These helpers contain the code for our telemetry schemas as well as example queries. Updating documentation: Holly Kassel is a product manager working on billing and licensing. She\u2019s been updating GitHub\u2019s documentation to be more user-friendly based on questions arriving through our customer support channels and discussion posts. She creates spaces for each new batch of documentation which needs to be updated, links the existing code and documentation hosted in GitHub, and adds instructions and frequently asked questions as context. The space generates updated versions of the documentation which can be easily copied into our docs repo. And more We\u2019ve also been having fun with them. Hubbers created a personal finance space for answering questions about vesting and other benefits, an offsite space for consolidating travel information, and a wombat Space for, uh, wombats?
