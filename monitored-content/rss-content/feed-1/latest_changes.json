      "content": "Copilot coding agent can now run its development environment on your own infrastructure using self-hosted GitHub Actions runners managed by Actions Runner Controller (ARC). That means agent tasks can reach internal packages, private build tooling, or on-prem services that aren\u2019t exposed to the public internet\u2014while still remaining ephemeral, isolated, and automated. \ud83e\udd16 What This Unlocks Use internal dependency registries or artifact stores (npm, Maven, PyPI mirrors, etc.). Run tests against services only reachable inside your network. Apply existing compliance / observability layers already baked into your runner fleet. Keep Copilot\u2019s environment disposable\u2014every task starts clean, ends clean. \ud83e\udde9 How It Works (Recap) Copilot coding agent executes tasks in a GitHub Actions-powered environment. By default we provision hosted runners. Now you can override the environment via copilot-setup-steps.yml and target an ARC scale set. \ud83d\udd27 Setup Steps Deploy ARC and create a scale set: Quickstart: https://docs.github.com/actions/tutorials/use-actions-runner-controller/quickstart Edit copilot-setup-steps.yml in the repository (or org standard) to point to your scale set via runs-on:. Commit & delegate a task to Copilot coding agent\u2014your agent now boots on your infra. jobs: copilot-setup-steps: runs-on: arc-scale-set-name steps: uses: actions/checkout@v4 Add any setup your internal environment needs name: Install private deps run: npm ci \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Security & Isolation Notes Each task still uses an ephemeral workspace\u2014no state leakage between tasks. Your existing runner-level security policies (network ACLs, scanning, logging) apply automatically. Keep secrets management consistent with other ARC-based workflows. \u2705 Recommended First Uses Internal SDK refactors Dependency upgrades needing private registry access Integration tests hitting staging APIs behind a firewall Legacy monorepo tasks with custom internal toolchains \ud83d\udcce Tips Standardize a base copilot-setup-steps.yml template at the org level for consistency. Include lightweight caching if internal dependency retrieval is slow. Pair with CodeQL & secret scanning already built into coding agent for layered protection. \ud83d\udcd8 Learn More Customizing agent environment ARC quickstart \ud83d\udcac Feedback Let us know what\u2019s missing\u2014metrics visibility? multi-arch scale sets? runner health telemetry surfaced in the agent summary?

      "content": "Custom agents for GitHub Copilot make it easy for users and organizations to specialize their Copilot coding agent (CCA) through simple, file-based configurations. By adding a configuration file under .github/agents in a repository or in the {org}/.github repository, you can define agent personas that capture your team\u2019s workflows, conventions, and unique needs. These agents can be further tailored with prompts, tool selections, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to optimize for specific use cases. Anyone using GitHub Copilot can define and use custom agents, whether you\u2019re an individual developer, part of a team, or managing an organization. Custom agents work across Copilot coding agent in github.com, the Copilot CLI, and will be coming to a future release of Visual Studio Code. Key benefits Define agent specializations that act like focused teammates, using prompts and tool selections unique to your workflow. Add organization-specific or team-specific agents by placing configuration files in a known location in your repository or organization settings. Refine agent behaviors beyond standard Copilot instructions, making it easier to enforce coding conventions, compliance, or custom automations. Enable agents to use custom tools and MCP servers, giving you fine-grained control over how tasks are completed. Get started quickly by adding a simple markdown file. There\u2019s no need for a separate installation or complex setup. Examples Imagine a frontend engineer subagent that enforces team conventions for React or Vue, or an agent that uses a custom MCP to automate additional tasks with the GitHub CLI. With custom agents, you can define these behaviors in a central file, making them easily accessible and maintainable. Not sure where to begin? Some of our awesome partners have created custom agents to help you improve your workflow. You can find those and more sample agents at @github/awesome-copilot. \ud83c\udf1fLeave a comment!

      "content": "Enterprise owners with GitHub Enterprise Cloud can assign Copilot Business licenses inside an enterprise account independent of granting any organizational access. This experience provides a flexible, more scalable Copilot Business licensing model to enterprises without requiring a GitHub Enterprise Cloud license per user. To assign Copilot Business licenses through an enterprise account, your users will need to already exist in the enterprise, whether as a preexisting organization member or as an unaffiliated user. Whether you assign to the user directly or through an enterprise team, enterprise owners can use the dedicated Copilot Business licensing page to assign these licenses. If a user is assigned both through an organization and through the enterprise directly, they will only consume one license, and they will have access to the highest Copilot license assigned to them. The new dedicated licensing page provides enterprise owners with: An overview of current Copilot license consumption in the enterprise. A centralized place to enable Copilot across the enterprise and its organizations. The ability to manage Copilot Business direct assignments across users and enterprise teams. For new enterprises who start with our GitHub trial, the experience has been updated to allow enterprise owners to try out this new licensing experience on day one. Enterprise owners can convert their trial with only the Copilot Business licenses assigned at the enterprise license and add in GitHub Enterprise Cloud licenses later as needed.

      "content": "GitHub Copilot now features Instant semantic code search indexing! This dramatically reduces indexing time from approximately 5 minutes to just a few seconds (maximum 60 seconds in some cases). What this means for you Now when you open a repository, Copilot can almost immediately provide contextually-aware assistance specific to your codebase. Semantic Code Search, one of GitHub Copilot's most powerful capabilities, enables Copilot to: Provide responses specific to your codebase's architecture and patterns. Reference existing functions, classes, and implementations in your repo. Suggest code that aligns with your project's style and conventions. Answer questions about your codebase with accurate, context-aware information. How to use it The indexing process starts automatically when you open GitHub Copilot Chat on github.com. VS Code users with the GitHub Copilot extension can manually trigger indexing through the Copilot UI when needed. Availability This feature is now available to all GitHub Copilot users across all tiers, including the free tier, with no limits on how many repositories can be indexed. More information For detailed information about repository indexing, check out our documentation. What do you think about this improvement? Have you noticed a difference in your workflow?

      "content": "TL;DR Scattered tribal knowledge throttles onboarding, cross-team work, and agent outcomes. Copilot pulls trusted context into the flow of work so everyone ships faster. Pair Copilot Spaces, Coding Agent, Agent Mode, and Copilot Code Review to hit the big four wins: faster time-to-first-PR, fewer interrupts to senior engineers, consistent patterns, and stronger autonomous results. Below you\u2019ll find an urgency hook, discovery prompts, a pilot plan, objection handling, and a resource stack that keeps knowledge current in IDEs, PRs, and automated workflows. Why this matters The average large U.S. business loses $47M every year to inefficient knowledge sharing; workers burn ~5.3 hours a week searching for answers or recreating past work.[^1][^2] A 1,000-person knowledge workforce can waste $2.5\u2013$3.5M annually hunting for non-existent or hard-to-find info\u2014plus ~$15M in opportunity cost.[^3] Developers spend ~17 hours/week on maintenance and ~4 hours/week on \u201cbad code,\u201d implying ~$85B in global productivity drag.[^4] Better knowledge sharing boosts knowledge-worker productivity by 20\u201325%.[^5] Use these proof points to frame a 30\u201390 day pilot with execs who care about onboarding speed, duplicate work, and senior focus time. Who to target Customers with onboarding friction, siloed standards, or inconsistent practices\u2014anywhere \u201cHow do I\u2026?\u201d questions slow delivery. Ideal customer profile: New devs take 1\u20133 months to land their first meaningful PRs; leadership cites long waits for the first three PRs.[^6] Know-how sits in experts\u2019 heads or outdated wikis; \u201cWhere\u2019s the doc?\u201d pings flood Slack/Teams. Standards vary by squad, resulting in duplicated implementations and frequent \u201cplease follow the guidelines\u201d PR nudges. Senior ICs lose deep-work hours answering basic Q&A. Signals to look for: No clear single source of truth for architecture, APIs, runbooks, or conventions. High time-to-first-PR for new hires; constant interrupts to senior engineers. Evidence of reinvented solutions, missed standards, or quality regressions in PRs. Talk track: discovery + business framing Start by uncovering where knowledge breaks today: \u201cWhat questions do new developers ask repeatedly?\u201d \u201cWhere do developers go for onboarding or when they\u2019re stuck?\u201d \u201cWhich standards do teams most often miss, rediscover, or debate?\u201d \u201cHow do you provide trusted, customized knowledge to AI tools or agents today?\u201d \u201cHow do you keep documentation from going stale?\u201d Reframe the answers in business terms: Faster onboarding \u2192 reduce time-to-first-PR by giving new hires a Space that \u201cknows your systems.\u201d Fewer interrupts \u2192 senior engineers regain focus time as common questions resolve inside the IDE or chat. Consistency and quality \u2192 everyone follows the same vetted examples, cutting defects and rework. Agent-ready \u2192 via MCP, the same vetted context powers internal tools and autonomous agents. Three ways Copilot scales institutional knowledge Embedded best practices in the flow of work Copilot completions, chat answers, and code review comments reflect org-wide standards, repo idioms, and golden-path snippets. New contributors code like they\u2019ve already internalized the expert playbook. Reduced dependency on gatekeepers Spaces curate live code, runbooks, standards, and how-tos. Copilot surfaces context proactively so developers don\u2019t need to \u201ctap the shoulder\u201d of a veteran teammate. Faster onboarding and continuous knowledge transfer Domain language, framework nuances, and migration recipes appear where work happens\u2014IDE, PRs, agent prompts\u2014so knowledge sharing is real time, not quarterly training. Step-by-step pilot plan (30\u201390 days) Phase What to do Outcome Identify the opportunity Baseline time-to-first-PR for recent hires, volume of repeated Q&A, duplicated work examples; tie the pain to delayed features, lost senior capacity, or quality hits. Clear urgency + ROI hypothesis. Introduce Copilot Spaces Stand up a Space for one flagship product; attach live repos, key docs, concise standards/how-tos. Run a hands-on demo answering real questions with linked sources. Optionally show how an internal agent would query the Space via MCP. Stakeholders see trusted answers in context. Define success Set a concrete goal (e.g., cut TTFPR by 20% in 60\u201390 days, halve senior interrupts). Document the owner and success plan. Shared pilot scorecard. Track usage and impact Monitor Space analytics (queries/day, unique users, top topics). Capture user quotes. Measure outcome deltas vs. baseline: onboarding speed, repeat questions, standard violations. Evidence that knowledge flows improved. Prove business outcomes Translate results for execs: regained senior capacity, faster delivery, improved consistency. Recommend scaling to additional domains, onboarding flows, and agent workflows. Expansion path + budget request. Example flow summary Ask: Run a 30\u201390 day pilot on one critical service to quantify impact. Week 0: Enable Copilot Spaces; capture baseline metrics (onboarding, Q&A load). Weeks 1\u20134+: Team uses Space; you track usage and outcomes; collect anecdotes. Readout: Show faster onboarding, fewer interrupts, better consistency; propose scale-out. Be ready for common objections \u201cWe already have a wiki.\u201d \u2192 Wikis go stale. Spaces ties live code and docs to AI answers inside the dev workflow, with citations to original sources.[^5] \u201cCan we trust the answers?\u201d \u2192 Responses are grounded in your repos/docs; you curate sources and visibility. \u201cIs this secure?\u201d \u2192 Data stays in your GitHub tenancy; access respects repo governance and branch protection. \u201cIs setup heavy?\u201d \u2192 Connect key repos/docs in minutes; Spaces stay up to date automatically as code changes. Keep knowledge fresh Treat Spaces and .github/copilot-instructions.md as living assets\u2014schedule monthly reviews. Pin authoritative docs and retire stale references so Copilot\u2019s context remains trustworthy. Capture success stories: when Copilot resolves a question or an agent completes a task, feed the insights back into your instructions. Pair with Copilot Code Review to reinforce conventions at PR time and catch drift early.
