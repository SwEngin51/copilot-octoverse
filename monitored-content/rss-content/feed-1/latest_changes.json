      "content": "We're bringing you a range of additional options for assigning Copilot to issues as part of this public preview. When assigning an issue to Copilot coding agent, you can now choose which repository Copilot should work in, pick a starting branch, and provide additional instructions to give it more context. CCA.issue.assign.mp4 Here\u2019s what\u2019s new: Start Copilot assignment in one click: Assign tasks directly to Copilot with the new Assign to Copilot button. This feature makes it easier and faster to start a Copilot assignment with a single click. Pick the target repository: Choose any repository you have access to, even if your issues and code don't live in the same place. Now you can work with Copilot across repositories, so it's easy to start assignments from issues no matter where your code is stored. Pick a starting branch: Choose which branch Copilot should start from. Whether you want Copilot to work off a feature branch, a bug fix branch, or any other starting point, you now have the flexibility to direct Copilot\u2019s work to exactly where you want it. Add additional instructions: Give Copilot more context with optional instructions. You can provide specific guidance, requirements, or extra details to help Copilot understand exactly what you want to accomplish. This makes assignments more precise and helps Copilot deliver results that match your needs. For more details, check out our documentation on assigning Copilot to an issue. \ud83d\udc47 Want to share feedback on this public preview or join the conversation? Please comment below!

      "published": "2025-09-18T10:12:44+00:00",
      "content": "Starting November 18, 2025, GitHub will begin removing all $0 Copilot premium request budgets for enterprise and team accounts created before August 22, 2025. As a result, premium request paid usage will be governed by your account\u2019s premium request paid usage policy, not a static $0 budget. Who is affected? All enterprise and org accounts with an account-level $0 Copilot premium request budget created before August 22, 2025 are affected. Pro and Pro+ Copilot users are not affected and will continue to have $0 budgets by default. Why are we making this change? Enables granular controls without complexity: Starting in October, each AI tool will have their own dedicated SKUs for tracking and managing premium request usage, beginning with coding agent and Spark. Keeping the $0 budget model would require you to manually create and manage separate $0 budgets for each new AI tool, creating unnecessary administrative burden as we expand our AI capabilities. Simplifies billing: Removing this budget option eliminates friction and manual intervention for admins, letting you scale AI usage with confidence. What do you need to do? To control premium request paid usage, review and update your premium request paid usage policy. You can disable paid usage at any time in your Copilot policy settings. Learn more in our documentation on premium requests. Questions For questions, feedback, and any thoughts, please comment in the discussion below!",

      "content": "Ever wish Copilot understood your project as well as your teammates do? Now it can. With Copilot Spaces, you can bring together the context Copilot needs (e.g. files, pull requests, issues, repos) into \"Spaces\". The result? Copilot gives you responses that are grounded in the right context for a specific task. Create a space Organize code, files, pull requests, issues and other project context into a space. Add custom instructions to help guide responses. We\u2019ve made some adjustments to how Copilot works with context in Spaces, so context groundedness should be very high. Context is always based on the latest state of your main branch. Files and repositories added to a space are always kept up to date as they change, making Copilot an evergreen expert in your project. Chat with a space Ask Copilot questions grounded in the context of your Space for more accurate and relevant answers. Share it with teammates You can share spaces with other members of your organization. Spaces in the IDE Access your Space context directly from supported IDEs through the remote GitHub MCP Server. \ud83d\udcc2 Do more with Spaces and use it to: Generate code Share knowledge Plan projects Some of our favorite use cases \u2b50 Answering questions about code: Chris Westra is an engineer on the Spaces team. He grouped all of the code associated with Spaces and added video transcripts from a recorded Spaces session. We use this Space to answer questions about how Spaces works under-the-hood (very meta). \ud83d\ude42 Standardizing coding standards and best practices: Rahul Zhade works on a team that advises engineers on secure coding practices. He often answers the same questions over-and-over again in Slack, so he set up a Space. It contains the documentation for our standard auth model, how to do cryptography as well as instructions on how to go through the security review process. Writing SQL/KQL queries: Kelly Henckel is a product manager who is very good at writing SQL and KQL queries. She\u2019s created spaces designed to help people self-service writing data queries and creating dashboards. These helpers contain the code for our telemetry schemas as well as example queries. Updating documentation: Holly Kassel is a product manager working on billing and licensing. She\u2019s been updating GitHub\u2019s documentation to be more user-friendly based on questions arriving through our customer support channels and discussion posts. She creates spaces for each new batch of documentation which needs to be updated, links the existing code and documentation hosted in GitHub, and adds instructions and frequently asked questions as context. The space generates updated versions of the documentation which can be easily copied into our docs repo. Please share feedback with us \ud83e\udd1d We appreciate your feedback.
