      "content": "Copilot Spaces is a new feature within GitHub Copilot. You can organize and centralize relevant content\u2014like code, docs, files, and (soon) issues\u2014into \u201cSpaces\u201d that ground Copilot\u2019s responses in the right context for a specific task. Key Features \u2728 Create a space Organize code, docs, files, and other project context into a space. Add custom instructions to help guide responses. We\u2019ve made some adjustments to how Copilot works with context in Spaces, so context groundedness should be very high. Context is always based on the latest state of your main branch. Chat with a space Ask Copilot questions grounded in the context of your Space for more accurate and relevant answers. Share it with teammates You can share spaces with other members of your organization. Some of our favorite use cases \u2b50 Answering questions about code: Chris Westra is an engineer on the Spaces team. He grouped all of the code associated with Spaces and added video transcripts from a recorded Spaces session. We use this Space to answer questions about how Spaces works under-the-hood (very meta). \ud83d\ude42 Standardizing coding standards and best practices: Rahul Zhade works on a team that advises engineers on secure coding practices. He often answers the same questions over-and-over again in Slack, so he set up a Space. It contains the documentation for our standard auth model, how to do cryptography as well as instructions on how to go through the security review process. Writing SQL/KQL queries: Kelly Henckel is a product manager who is very good at writing SQL and KQL queries. She\u2019s created spaces designed to help people self-service writing data queries and creating dashboards. These helpers contain the code for our telemetry schemas as well as example queries. Updating documentation: Holly Kassel is a product manager working on billing and licensing. She\u2019s been updating GitHub\u2019s documentation to be more user-friendly based on questions arriving through our customer support channels and discussion posts. She creates spaces for each new batch of documentation which needs to be updated, links the existing code and documentation hosted in GitHub, and adds instructions and frequently asked questions as context. The space generates updated versions of the documentation which can be easily copied into our docs repo. And more We\u2019ve also been having fun with them. Hubbers created a personal finance space for answering questions about vesting and other benefits, an offsite space for consolidating travel information, and a wombat Space for, uh, wombats? Anyways\u2026 Please share feedback with us \ud83e\udd1d This is an early preview, so we appreciate your feedback. Give spaces a try and let us know what you think either in this discussion post or through the inline feedback button. Go to Spaces \ud83d\ude80 See the detailed changelog post.

This will provide you with simplified control over how your enterprise or organization handles premium request usage beyond your account's included usage. What's changing Instead of an automatically-created $0 budget that blocks usage when your premium requests are exhausted, you can now manage overages through a dedicated policy in your Copilot settings. The policy offers you two options: Enabled (default) - Allow charges for usage beyond your account's included premium requests Disabled - Block usage when your included premium requests are exhausted If you have an existing $0 premium request budget in your account, it will not be removed. You can remove or modify this budget at any time. What's not changing Copilot for individuals (Pro/Pro+) plans are not affected at this time.
